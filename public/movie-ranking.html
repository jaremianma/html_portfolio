<h1>The Best Movies According to Marijo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/"><h3>Lord of the Rings</h3></a>
<p>This is not only my favorite movie, but also my favorite book.</p>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls068935221/"><h3>The Star Wars franchise.</h3></a>
<p>I also include movies and series. What can I say, I'm a fan. :)</p>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1158527769/?playlistId=tt0108052&ref_=tt_ov_vi"><h3>Schindler's List.</h3></a>
<p>
  To me, one of the best films based on a true event. Proof of how one can
  remain human in the darkest days of mankind.
